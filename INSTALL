Building MathyResurrected from source
====================================

Prerequisites:
--------------

	- Qt v4.6.0
		- http://qt.nokia.com/
		- IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!
		- plugin will build with any 4.x.x version of Qt but it will fail 
		  to load in Launchy unless it was built with exactly the same 
		  version of Qt that Launchy was built with. This means that you
		  absolutely must use Qt v4.6.0 for Launchy v2.5 and Qt must be 
		  compiled with Visual Studio 2005. Taken from Launchy BUILD.txt
		  you must use Qt's configure like this:
		  
			configure -opensource -no-webkit
		
		- to understand better this issue see:
			http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/deployment-plugins.html
			http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/plugins-howto.html
			(section: Loading and Verifying Plugins Dynamically)
		- You can find older versions of Qt on Qt's FTP server accessible 
		  from Qt site, in /src directory.
	
	- ANTLR C runtime v3.2 or higher (libantlr3c)
		- http://www.antlr.org/download/C
		
	- Boost v1.34 or higher
		- http://www.boost.org/
		
Build process
-------------

	Make sure that Qt and libantlr3c are on your build path then run:
	
		$ qmake 
		$ make release
	
	If you're using Visual Studio Compiler start Visual Studio Command
prompt and type:

		$ qmake 
		$ nmake release

Visual Studio Solution
======================

	Visual Studio project file can be generated by running:
	
		& qmake -tp vc 
		
	in top project directory. 
	
	To be sure that approšriate version is used, make sure that Qt enviroment is 
set up properly before issuing qmake command. This means that enviroment 
variables QMAKESPEC and QTDIR must be set properly and match used Visual Studio
version. Qt usually sets these for you during instalation, but if that's not the
case, they must be ensured manually. 

	Before project can be built using generated Visual Studio project files, 
Visual Studio must be set up to be able to find antlr C runtime includes and
library.
