Building MathyResurrected from source
====================================

Prerequisites:
--------------

	- Qt v4.6.0
		- http://qt.nokia.com/
		- IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!
		- plugin will build with any 4.x.x version of Qt but it will fail 
		  to load in Launchy unless it was built with exactly the same 
		  version of Qt that Launchy was built with. This means that you
		  absolutely must use Qt v4.6.0 for Launchy v2.5 and Qt must be 
		  compiled with Visual Studio 2005. Taken from Launchy BUILD.txt
		  you must use Qt's configure like this:
		  
			configure -opensource -no-webkit
		
		- to understand better this issue see:
			http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/deployment-plugins.html
			http://qt.nokia.com/doc/4.6/plugins-howto.html
			(section: Loading and Verifying Plugins Dynamically)
		- You can find older versions of Qt on Qt's FTP server accessible 
		  from Qt site, in /src directory.
	
	- ANTLR C runtime v3.2 or higher (libantlr3c)
		- http://www.antlr.org/download/C
		
	- Boost v1.34 or higher
		- http://www.boost.org/
		
Build process
-------------

	Make sure that Qt and libantlr3c are on your build path then run:
	
		$ qmake 
		$ make release
	
	If you're using Visual Studio Compiler start Visual Studio Command
prompt and type:

		$ qmake 
		$ nmake release

Visual Studio 2005 Solution
===========================

	There is Visual Studio 2005 solution ready available. Before you can 
build project you must setup Visual Studio so that it has Qt and 
libantlr3c in it's include and lib path.
