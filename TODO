
- replace mod operator with something else, and use % to add percent operator
- add factorial operator and function.

- better error control and reporting (currently almost none)
	- find unmatched braces in expresion
	- find things that look like function but are not defined
	- detect border conditions for functions and return "NaN", 
	  "Domain error", "Inf" and stuff like that...
	- detect overflow, underflow and similar numeric problems with results
	- put error messages into translatable resources
	- this can been done using already installed lexer error collector
	  (lexer gramar needs to be updated to report more errors and then these
	  errors should be checked before parser is run)
	- parser and tree parser can also be checked for errors using custom 
	  displayRecognitionError:
	    
	@parser::apifuncs {
		// Install custom error message display: 
		RECOGNIZER->displayRecognitionError = throwParserException;
		// after this add implementation of throwParserException into 
		// bridge API
	}
